# This is a trial assignment to test out how we can use Github
# Don't worry about messing up!

# Iteration

# Write a for loop that asks the user for a number and outputs the times table
# for that number up to 10 times
# Use the variable identifier num1 for this program





# Selection

# Ask for a number and store it in a variable with the identifier num2
# if the number is less than 7 output the text "Too low!"
# if the number is 7 then output the text "Just right!"
# if the number is more than 7 output the text "Too big!"
